# Week-2-Project-2-Statistical-Plots-and-Distribution-Analysis
Statistical plots and distribution analysis using Seaborn on the Students Performance in Exams dataset.
# Project-2: Statistical Plots & Distribution Analysis

## 📌 Dataset
Students Performance in Exams (Kaggle)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Objective
To analyze data distributions using statistical plots such as histograms, KDE plots, and boxplots, and to compare distributions across different groups.

## 📂 Files
- `Project_2_Statistical_Distribution.ipynb` – Main analysis notebook
- `Student Performance.csv` – Dataset
- `math_score_by_gender.png` – Exported plot
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 🚀 Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset using Pandas
2. Performed data inspection and summary statistics
3. Created histogram and KDE plots
4. Used boxplots to detect outliers
5. Compared score distributions across gender
6. Exported plots for reporting
7. Interpreted the results

## 📈 Key Observations
- Math scores show a moderately symmetric distribution
- Majority of scores lie between 60 and 80
- A few low-score outliers are present
- Gender-based comparison shows slight median differences with similar variability

## ✅ Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates statistical plots and distribution analysis using Seaborn, fulfilling all requirements of SyntaxHub Project-2.
